# Voice Input
+ Speech to text transcription using Groq

## Description
This project is a voice input application that uses the [Groq](https://groq.com/) API to transcribe audio files. It uses the [customtkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter) library for the GUI.

> **Note:** Groq provides a generous **free usage tier** thatâ€™s more than enough for typical personal use.  
> No credit card is required to get started.
